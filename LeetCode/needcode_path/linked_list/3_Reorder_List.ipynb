    "# 143. Reorder List\n",

    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln\n",
    "Reorder the list to be on the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …\n",
    "You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.\n",

    "[neetcodevideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5bfdUTrKLM&t=1s&ab_channel=NeetCode)\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider solution that has O(n) time complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also consider O(1) extra space. Which is more difficult. My initial solution guess involved creating a separate List that is reversed and combining the two. But this would be O(n). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another O(n) solution is to create and `array` and store each node in an array, than go throgh the array with `two pointers` to change links in the existing linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without using extra memory the algorithm is the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__ that this problem is essentially a problem of _merging two linked lists_, iterating the order. So this is mergning from the beginning and end of two halfs of the lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty is to have a pointer at the end of the second half of the linked list and _move it left_ not right, where the 'next' connection leads. \n",
    "the solution is to _inverse all links_ in the second half of the original linked list. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem can be solved in two steps:\n",
    "- Reverse links in the second half of the array\n",
    "- Combine/merge both halfs iterating the link\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the middle of the linked list we can use `fast and slow pointer` technique. This is done as following:  \n",
    "- Slow is0 = 0; and is0+=1\n",
    "- Fast if0 = 1; and if0+=2\n",
    "untill fast pointer reaches the _end of the list_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for _evel list_ the slow pointer will point at the last node of the first half of the linked list. \n",
    "\n",
    "For _odd list_ the slow pointer would be right at the middle and we would need to chose what is the size of the half that we need. We chose to consider the left half + center as a left half and right half - center as the right half, as we need to insert the right _inside_ the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: in the second part of the algorithm, we need to save original links between nodes _before_ we break them for node insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "__NODE__: for the last node of the first half we need to set it to point at 'None' as it is now the end of the list\n"
