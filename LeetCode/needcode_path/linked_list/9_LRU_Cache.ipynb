    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)\n",

    "Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the LRUCache class:\n",
    "\n",
    "LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.\n",
    "int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.\n",
    "void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.\n",
    "The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.\n",

    "__NOTE__: this is a popular problem, e.g., twitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part is to solve this problem with O(1) time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The _idea_ is to store values in order, so we remember when we stored he value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to return a value at O(1) time, we need to se a `hash map`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this `hash map` we keep the value of the key as a key and __pointer to the node__ as value. \n",
    "\n",
    "At get() we retrun the value of a node of an entry in a hash map. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep track on the most and least recent entry by having two pointers. So that \n",
    "- _right_ is the most recent, and\n",
    "- _left_ is least recent\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need a `double linked list`.  \n",
    "`!` This is because each time we use an entry in a hash map we need to shift the associated nodes. Each time we use 'get()' we need to move the entry as the most recently used. Using array would requrie O(n).   \n",
    "__NOTE__: in this case the hash map will not be updated, as pointers are already pointing at correct nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the key data structures:\n",
    "- value for the capacity\n",
    "- hash map values as keys of a hash map and values as pointers to the double linked list nodes\n",
    "- double linked list with each node having \n",
    "    - key\n",
    "    - val\n",
    "    - prev pointer\n",
    "    - next pointer\n",
    "- Plus two additional nodels for 'most left' and 'most right'"
