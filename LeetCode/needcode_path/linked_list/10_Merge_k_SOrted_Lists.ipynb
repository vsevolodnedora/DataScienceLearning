    "In leetcode 21 we did merging of 2 sorted linked lists. There we created a 'Dummy' node and looped over both linked lists at the same time and appended a new node with the smallest value untill the end.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An _inefficient_ idea is to merge linked lists progressively. Start with one pair and keep adding new node based on its value. This requires looping through the newly created list each time we want to add a. This would be O(k*n) time comlexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "A _more efficient way_ is as in an algorithm `merge sort`, where we merge pairs only, untill all parts used. Then we mrge the pairs among the result from first pairs. This requries al algorithm _merge two sorted linked lists_ to be used.  \n",
    "In this algorithm, when we go through all nodes at the beginnign, this is O(n) operation. However, we do not need to do it each time when we merge, so each time, after each merger we decrease the list size by 2. Thus, we would need to merge lists only 'log(k)' times. This is the efficnet part. The overall time complexity is O(n*log(k))\n",

    "The basis of the solution is implementing a function to merge two linked lists"
