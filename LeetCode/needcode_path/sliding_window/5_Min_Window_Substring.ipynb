    "The Brute force solution here involves `hash maps` for both strings and comparing them for each substring of 's'. \n",

    "4. Initilize 'having' varaible, that is a number of cahractars needed in the window to staisfy the result\n",
    "3. For each increment of the right pionter do:\n",
    "    - Add new character to the winodw hash map and if the count for this character is now equal to the one needed in the static hahsmap, increment 'having' varaible by 1\n",
    "    - Check if the 'having' now is what is needed, and while it is so (use while)\n",
    "        - Update the result (legth via r - l + 1)\n",
    "        - shrink the window from the left by removing character from the window hash map (if this character is one of the required ones, decrement the window hasmap and if it is now no longer satisfies the count needed, decrement 'having' varaible. This would make the 'while' loop break and would continou the main 'for loop)"
