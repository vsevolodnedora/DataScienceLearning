    "\n",
    "Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement KthLargest class:\n",
    "\n",
    "KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.\n",
    "int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.\n",

    "_Stream_ add numbers continously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to return 'kth' largest as if the array was sorted.  \n",
    "The initial list of number may be <= than k element. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function 'add()' should return the kth largest each time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting a value into a sorted array is a linear time operation O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can just sort the array and then use a binary search.  \n",
    "However, then each time we add a new value we would need to sort the array again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid it we will use a `min heap`. \n",
    "Adding and poping values from min heap is done in _log(n)_ time instead of O(n) for an array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this problem, is that we will only add nubers, not removing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In min heap, the kth largest value is always the kth element in the heap from the end.  The heap structure is preserved, as we _never_ remove values from min heap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use a min heap becasese we will _only add values_. The ''k' value is always the same, so we only need the min heap up to 'k' so that we can pop the min value in O(1) time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the add function can be done in 2 * log(n) times which is just log(n).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the heap is O(nlog(n)) in the worst case, bease creating a heap is O(n), but than we need to pop elements untill 'k' which is O(log(n-k)), but the add function will be O(log(n))\n",
