    "However, then each time we add a new value we would need to sort the array again.  \n",

    "To avoid it we will use a `min heap`. \n",
    "Adding and poping values from min heap is done in _log(n)_ time instead of O(n) for an array.  \n",

    "The advantage of this problem, is that we will only add nubers, not removing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In min heap, the kth largest value is always the kth element in the heap from the end.  The heap structure is preserved, as we _never_ remove values from min heap.  \n",
