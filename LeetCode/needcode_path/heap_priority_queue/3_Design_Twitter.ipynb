    "Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed.\n",

    "Implement the Twitter class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter() Initializes your twitter object.\n",
    "void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) Composes a new tweet with ID tweetId by the user userId. Each call to this function will be made with a unique tweetId.\n",
    "List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId) Retrieves the 10 most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.\n",
    "void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with ID followerId started following the user with ID followeeId.\n",

    "__NOTE__: this problem is similar to the \"Merge K-sorted lists\" problmem\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem is to figure out which data structureds to use for each function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any user can _follow_ another user with differnt IDs. The simplest idea is to have a _hash map_ so that: \n",
    "- userID -> List of followeeID (each time aa new user follows, we extend the list)\n",
    "\n",
    "To _unfollow_ it is not easy, as the removing from the list is a O(n) time operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "`!` A data structure that can be used add and remove in O(1), is the _hash set_.  -> \n",
    "- userID -> hash set of followeeID; than _follow_ and _unfollow_ can be realized with O(1) time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A user can post many tweets, so userID -> [tweetID], if we just use hash map, where we add the user to the end, this is O(1) time. So it ma work\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complex function to implement, is the 'getNewsFeed(userID)' that must retreave 10 most recent tween IDs in the user's feed _from the list of the users that this user follows_ and that they need to be _ordered from the most recent to the least recent_. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the 10 most recent we can just return 10 last tweets from the list. However, for many users, we need to \"__merge these lists__\" to get the most recent feeds. In order to do that we need to _keep track on the time_ that the tweet was posted. So we need to have lost of 'counts' (time) and associated tweetID, so we can merge the post histories to get the _ordered feed_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we will be usin a `min heap` as there is not `max heep`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, when a user requests a news feed, we \n",
    "1. Get the list of users this user follows (get the `has set` of users from our `hash map`)\n",
    "2. For each followeeID, get the list of tweets (from the second `hash map`), where we get lists of _counts_ and _tweets_\n",
    "3. Getting the combined, 10 most recent tweets, is equivalent to _merge K-sorted lists_ problem. The time complexity of this problem is O(10 * K), where K is the number of users, the user follows. A more efficient way to do this, is to set K pointers for the end of each user tweet lists and create a `min heap` out of them, and to get the minimum value. The minimum of the heap is O(log(K)) time, as since we would need to do it 10 times, the overall time coplxity is O(10 * log(K)).  \n",
    "__NOTE__: however, creating the min heap, also requries time. Just pushing values into it is O(K*log(K)) or using `heapify` which O(k), so the overall time complexity would __still be O(k)__ which we originally had without heap. However, if we would need to get not 10 but N tweets, than heap would make the algorithm more efficient.  \n",
