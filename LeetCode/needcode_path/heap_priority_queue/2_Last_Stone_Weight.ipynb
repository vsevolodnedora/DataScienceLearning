    "\n",
    "You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:\n",
    "\n",
    "If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and\n",
    "If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.\n",

    "- take the heaviest stones and smash them together and introduce a new stone. \n",
    "\n",
    "__KEY__: is to maintain the ordered structure of the stone list. \n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure that allows us to do that is a `max heap`, as we need heaviest stones at each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Transforming an array into a heap is O(n) time operation; \n",
    "- Get maximum from the heap O(log(n)). Since we do it N times, the overall time complexity is O(n*log(n))\n",
