    "# 973. K Closest Points to Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\n",

    "Starting from the origin, we need to compute the eukledian distance to each point and return K closest ones. Note, that the sqrt() operation in the Euklidian distance is not needed here, we just compare, not estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need K points, and the simple solution is to sort the list of points. The time complexity of it is O(n*log(n)). However, not, we do not really need to sort an entire list. We can use `min heap` to pop K values from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For each point, we compute the distance, put it as a first value in the list (coordinate)\n",
