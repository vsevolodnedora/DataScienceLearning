    "# 130. Surrounded Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "[neetcodevideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z2BunfoZ5Y&t=1s)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find regions (islands) that are 4-direction surounded by 'x' (boundary does not count), so if the 'o' is on the border, we do not count it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible solution is to run a DFS or BFS, but it is complicated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible solution is to consider a _reverse problem_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to capture _the surrounded regions only_. The opposite is capturing _everything_ __except__ surrounded regions. This qutomatically includes all bourder connecting regions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Scan through every border cell and find a region and count it as a non-surround region and run a DFS on it to get the enire regions that we do not need. Temporary mark it with a different character. Then do a double nested loop and every time we see an \"O\" we change it into \"X\" while new marker, e.g., \"T\" markes the region that we _do not need to change_. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Overall_ instead of looking for surround regions inside the board, we will look for _non surrounded regions_ that connect to the boundary of the board. Mark these regions with a different value so we do not touch them later, and then go through the enire board and flip \"O\"->\"X\". This is a simpler solution with time complexity O(n*m)\n"
