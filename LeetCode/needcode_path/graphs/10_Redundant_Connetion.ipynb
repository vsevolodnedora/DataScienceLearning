    "In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.\n",

    "Naive, DFS solution has a complexity O(n^2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution that gives O(n) is a `Union find` which is a reare algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__, the reason why we can use union find, is because of the _no cycles_ in the intro.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: this graph used to be a tree. Undaracted. N nodes. Add an edge, that connected two verticies.  \n",
    "The task is to find an _edge_ that should be remived to turn the graph into a tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`!` If the n_edges = n_nodes -> there is a loop in the graph.   \n",
    "`!` Adding an edge to a fully connected graph _creats a cycle_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason why we can use `union find`. The graph is fully connected and has a redundant connection that adds a loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider here a `union find by rank`, the most efficient form of the algorithm.  \n",
    "- Iterate over each edge\n",
    "- Assign a rank based on the size of the graph\n",
    "- Ceate tree-like connection between nodes\n",
    "- Change the rank, based on the added connection (for parent and child nodes)\n",
    "- Thus, we ceep two lists: Parant [ node, node...] and Rank [int, int int ...]\n",
    "- The edges are added based on the input array of edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Find: If two nodes have exactly same parant and we want to add new edge to them, it will be a _redundant connection_. \n"
