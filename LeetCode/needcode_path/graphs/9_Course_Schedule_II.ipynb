    "There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.\n",

    "For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.\n",

    "The approach to solve this problem is to perform a `topological sort`, a standard graph algorithm.  \n",

    "- Starting at every single node, we run a `DFS`.  \n",
    "- Once we traverse the graph untill there are no more leafs, we add the final node to the output and remove the leaf from the list of nodes we need to visit (as we know we can visit). \n",
    "- Continue removing the nodes that are vistied and have no more prerequesites from the list of nodes we need to consider. \n",
    "- Every time we remove the node from the list, we add it to the result.  \n",
    "- Add remaining nodes that do not have prerequesites to the results _in order_. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a __topological sort of the graph__ which is _not unique_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the problem is O(E+V), where E is the number of edges and V - is the number of verticies.  \n",
