    "# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).\n",
    "\n",
    "The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each value in the grid is hight. Everything on the top and right - pacific\n",
    "Everyting on the left and bottom - atlanitc. \n",
    "So for each cell on the grid we need to check if there is a _path_ from it to both oceans of vlues <= cell value. Asuming again _no diagonal flow_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So for each value we need to check if there is this path of decreasing values that lead to both siland. This can be done via _DFS_ or _BFS_ algorithms for each single position.  \n",
    "The time complexity of this solution is O((n*m)^2). \n",
    "However, this can be improved if we note that we do repeated work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "the algorithm is the following: We start with the ocean and check which cells can reach it. Than starting from boundary nodes find the next nodes that can reach the Pacific. \n",
    "Same for the second ocean.  \n",
    "Note, we _still do the graph traversal_ but we start with the boundary nodes and we _do not revisit nodes_ twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "At every \"coast\" node we do a DFS. We keep track on visited cells.  \n",
    "Note, if we start from the ocean we need to look for cells that hare higher or equal than a given cell. "
