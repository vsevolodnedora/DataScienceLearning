    "\n",
    "For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n",

    "An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n",

    "WE need a _deep copy_, so we need to create a new graph. We do it using `hash map` and start with a node, and populate the hash map with _old_ and _new_ nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is recursive, as we need to traverse the entire graph.  \n",
    "In order to avoid cloning the same node many times, we have the hash map.  \n",
    "We go though the neighbours and if there the node is in the map, we skip it, otherwie  we create a clone and connect it with the clone of the neighbour. \n",
