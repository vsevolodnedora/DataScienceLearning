    "Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: grid = [\n",
    "  [\"1\",\"1\",\"1\",\"1\",\"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"1\",\"1\",\"0\",\"1\",\"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"1\",\"1\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"]\n",

    "__NOTE__: this is a general problem of finding clusters in a 2D array. Here the limitation is that island -- nodes connected vertically or horizontally, not diagonally.  \n",

    "One starts by drawing and discussing how one would solve this problem intuitively. \n",
    "- Go through each point on the grid, if it is 1, find all connected ones that are 1. Once finished, Nislands+=1 and start probing other points on the gird. Once found a new one, repeat. \n",

    "__Questions__: how to mark a set of points as visited. This is done via `Graph theory`.  \n",
    "We need to go through all neghbours of a given point. This is done via `Breadth-first search` algorithm, a _graph raversal algorithm_.  \n",
    "Than we arrive to a set of layers for each depth level.  "
