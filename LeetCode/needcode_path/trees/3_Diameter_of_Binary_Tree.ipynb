    "# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Path here is a set of _links_. We need to find the longest sequence of links _even_ if pass through the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__ theis problem involes _recursion_ as we keep advancing along the tree and adding to the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "`!` In order to consider recursion, we need to start from the __bottom__, from the leaves. \n",
    "\n",
    "A brute force solution, where we compute the 'diameter' at every node as we go top to bottom is O(n^2) as we repeat the 'searh' at every node, so we iterated through all nodes _twice_. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we start from the _bottom_ and do it _recursively_ we can do it in O(n) time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We initilize the 'max=0' and solve the problem for each subtree at each point. \n",
    "\n",
    "`!` main idea is as we traverse the tree _top to bottom_ we keep the depth of the tree at a current node, So for each node we store the 'diameter' and the 'height' but from the bottom. So in other words, we traverse the tree __bottom up__. \n",
    "So a leaf would have a diamter of 0 and hight of 0 as there are no other subtrees.  \n",
    "As we step back to the previos node, we store the 'max(heght)' of both subtrees as the hight at this point and add 1 to account for the edge. \n",
    "\n",
    "H = 1 + max(left,right)\n",
    "\n",
    "`!` By convention, a height of a Null tree is __-1__, because the hight of a tree with a single node is __0__. \n",
    "\n",
    "`!` A diameter of a tree at a given node is\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamete = LeftHeight + RightHeight + 1 + 1 ,\n",
    "\n",
    "where +1 +1 account for existing edges\n",

    "Solution involves implementing `dfs` algorithm"
