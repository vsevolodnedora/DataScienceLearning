    "__NOTE__: BFS may be not more efficient in this problem, but it allows to avoid recursion.  \n",

    "- to each appending attach a value representing the depth of the current level\n",

    "For non-recursive DFS we need a `stack` to implement a `pre-order` DFS. The algorithm is the following:\n",

    "    - In the normal _pre-order traversal_ we add the left subtree first.\n",
    "    - Look at the children of each subtree. If not processed go back to the last \n",
    "When traversing the tree this way we can add childred on the stack as well as depth\n",

    "At each iteration, we add the node the node, and then pop it and replace it with children.  \n",
