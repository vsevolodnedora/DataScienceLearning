    "Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.\n",

    "A brootforce solution is to check every single node on the larger tree whether a given node is a root of another tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "So For each position in the S tree we would need to run the comparison, so iterated over T.  \n",

    "- If both trees are Null: - they are the same\n",

    "Overall, solving this problem requires _two recursive_ functions. First one t ocomapre two trees, and the second one to go throug the S tree."
