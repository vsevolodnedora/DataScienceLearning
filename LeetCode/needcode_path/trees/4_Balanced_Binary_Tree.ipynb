    "starting from the root: do a `recursive DFS` to determine its height; for both left and rigth subtrees. Then we can determine if the tree is balanced at this point. This is O(n) operation. However we would need to repeat it each time we advance down the tree, os overal time compplexity will be O(n^2).  \n",

    "__NOTE__: the key is to keep track on the hight of each subtree as we move from bottom to top, so other way around. this is similar to the previos problem, where we were checking both sub-bracnhes or sub-trees at each node. Here, istead of _summing_ the both heights, we need to check if they differ by more than one. \n"
