    "- 1st value in _pre-order travrsal_ is the root. This is the root of the enire tree. \n",
    "So, we can always use the first value is the root. After which we can do _recursive traversal. However, it is unclear which value in the remaining list belong to the left or right subtree. \n",
    "- 2nd Make use that each value in both traversals is unique. There we know that nodes that go to the left subtree will be _on the left_ on the root that we just used from 1st. While each value on the right of the root will be from the right subtree. \n",

    "After we find 1st root, we remove it from the _pre-order_ and we traverse the left subtree using the _in-order_. After that we also remove each node we find there from the _in-order traversal_. So in the end we end up with a new _in-order_ with new root as a first element and new _in-order_ with root somewhere between its left subtree and its right subtree. And we repeat the process _recursively_. \n",
