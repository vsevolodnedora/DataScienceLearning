    "_Note_: in RPM operations are performed in a sequence. Once we have an operand in the list, we apply it to the previous two values. Then we can replace the two values with the result of the opeartion.  \n",

    "The key is the operator always is applied to _two previous numbers_ and the operation is done _in place_, meaning, we replace the two values with the value. \n",

    "If we use `stack` we continously push numbers and pop/replace the value once there is an operation. At the end, in the stack, there will be the result. \n",
