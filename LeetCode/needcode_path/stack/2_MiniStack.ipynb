    "The tricky part of this problem is that we want to retrive the _min_ in constant time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as a _datastructure_ a stack supports _adding on top (push)_, _poping_ and _getting top_ by default. These are already O(1) operations. A stack in python can be implemented with a _linked list_ or with an _array_. \n",
    "We are going to use built-in structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we naively look through each element of the stack to get the min, it is O(N) operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another naive way is to keep a _global_ min every time a value is added. However, this \n",
    "breaks if we pop this value and than have to search through the min again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here there is a hint:\n",
    "- Consider each node in the stack habinb a minimum value\n",
    "\n",
    "in other words for each position in the stack we have a value: __a min at this time__, so that when the value itself is popped, we can just fallback on the previous minimum value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some sense we would have two stacks in parallel. The actual values and the min stack that keeps track on current minima. Than, all operations, like adding, removing, are done on _both stacks_.\n",
