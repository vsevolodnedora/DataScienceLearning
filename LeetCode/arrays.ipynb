    "The problem requires us to remove duplicate elements from a sorted array, i.e., _we need to keep only one copy of each element in the array_.  \n",
    "Since the array is sorted, all duplicate elements will be _adjacent_ to each other, so we can easily remove them by shifting the subsequent elements of the array to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use two pointers $i$ and $j$, where $i$ points to the last unique element found so far, and $j$ points to the current element being examined. If $nums[i]$ and $nums[j]$ are equal, we just increment $j$. Otherwise, we increment $i$ and copy $nums[j]$ to $nums[i]$. At the end, we return $i+1$, which represents the length of the modified array.\n",
