# A beginnerâ€™s guide to modern natural language processing  
By Jodie Burchell, Developer Advocate in Data Science at JetBrains

__Evolution stages:__
- Rule based
    - Binary vectorization
    - Count vecotrization
- Neural nets
    - word2vec (all usages of a word in a training data and find what words surround it)
    - LLMs (successor to LSTMs)

__Example__:
- using 
```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
```

### Transformer models
- Using positional embedding as weights in addition to the word embeddings themselves. 
- Using self-attention mechansism
- Encoder block is the self-attention + normalization steps
- BERT model (not a generative LLM)
    - Predict an order of sentences 
    - Predict missing word
__Example__:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

### Discussion:
- How to deal with ovefitting: 
    - Use validation set (or even a test set as well)
    - Avoid black box, where _feature leacakge_ can become a problem 
- How to avoid overfitting in fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM for new tasks?
    - Unknwon...
- How to handle out-of-vocabluary words
    - Problematic for hard word2vec models
    - Less problematic for large LLMs
    - Main way to deal with them is to use old-school
- Recomendation for entry-level job
    - Do projects and start a blog and write about them (videos, notebooks)
