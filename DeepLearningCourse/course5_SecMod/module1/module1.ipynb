    "- Speach recognition\n",
    "- Music generation\n",
    "- Sentiment classification\n",
    "- DNA sequence analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a sentnece (seq. of words)  \n",
    "$x$ is a sentence. \n",
    "Find where are people's names in the problem: \n",
    "`Named-entity recognition` used by search engines (indexing the words for fast search).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Do one-hot encoding for names and not names (labels are 1 or 0, $y$-vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are $x^{<i>}$ or $x^{<t>}$ with length $T_x$ for temporal index  \n",
    "and outputs are $y^{<t>}$ with length $T_y$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For various sets the length can be different. \n",
    "In particular $T_x^{(i)}$ and $T_y^{(i)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing words is done making a dictionary or vocabluary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are set of indexed words with large number of them. Then, each word is a vector the length of the whole vocabluary with one-hot 1 for this word and 0 for the rest. These are `one-hot` vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to learn mapping the mapping to the target output $Y$ using this one-hot vector via `supervised learning`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the word is not in the vocabluary, use a  `UNK` (not in the vocabluary workd)\n",
