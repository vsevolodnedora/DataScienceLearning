# Install PostgreSQL 

I followed [ubuntu source](https://www.commandprompt.com/education/how-to-install-pgadmin-on-ubuntu/) and this [article](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/databases-postgresql) to set up the server. I am not sure it is correct. 

Oficial: [postgre](https://postgresql.org) 

I could have download an _installer_ from there... Eh... 

- Loading database : do it manually, load tarball
- call `refrash` on the database to update it
- use `Query Tool` to access the database
- `F5` is to run the query in Ppstgre
- The current result can be dowloaded as .scv
