# GenAI with LLMs Course

## Introduction 

GenAI and LLMs are general purpose technologies

Course taught by AWS team. 

GenAi project lifecycle. 

Deep technical understanding. 

Week1:
- Transformer architecture 
- In-Context learning (prompt engineering)
- Hyperparameter tuning

Week2:
- Instruction funetuning for LLMs

Week3:
- Alligning LLM output with human values

Each week has a lab in AWS enviroment. 
- Compare prompts for diolog summarization lab
- Improve output

- Fine tune a Hugging Face model
- PEFT

- RLHF fine tuning

### Transformers
- Massivly parallelizable on GPUs; that is made it very powerful
- Foundation of image transformers

### Generative AI project lifecycle 
- Planning to build a GenAI project
1. Choosing a model (pre-trained or training one yourself); Choosing/evaluating model; Choosing a model size. Depends on a use cases. Small models can still be used.
