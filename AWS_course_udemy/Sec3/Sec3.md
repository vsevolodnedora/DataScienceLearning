# What is Cloud computing

### Traditional overivew

- Websides work as: Client -> Network -> Server, where `packets` are routed.
- IP adresses allow _server_ to find _client_ and vise vers. (This is similar to mail system)

A server is composed of a 
- CPU for calculation
- RAM (fast memory)
- Storage for data
- Dabase for structured data (for searching and querying)
- Network: routers, switch, DNS server...

- __Network__: an infrastructure that connects _routers_ and _servers_. 
- __Router__: a networking device, forwarding packets between a computer and a _network_. 
- __Switch__: Forwards a packet to a correct _server_/_client_ in the _network_. 

The structure is 

> PC client <-> Router <-> Switch <-> MANY PCS (network)

Data center is comprised of servers and is a natural evolution of a single machine system. 

Disadvantages of classical IT data cetner infrastucture is 
- Expensive to maintain (rent...)
- Energy expenses, maintaince
- Limited scaling
- Adding/replacing is time consuming
- Reauries team to maintain the server
- Possible physical damage.

__Cloud__ Is a possible solution. It is an _on-demand_ delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and IT resources.  
- Usually accompnaied by _pay-as-you-go_ pricing.  
- Allows to allocate the right type and size of compute resources. 
- Almost instantaneous access
- Has interface for easy access of servers, storage, databases, application services
- AWS owns and maintains network-connected servicies
