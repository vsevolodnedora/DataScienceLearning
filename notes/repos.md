# Neural Networks  

> [JordiCorbilla/stock-prediction-deep-neural-learning](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/stock-prediction-deep-neural-learning)
__AIM__: Predicting stock prices can be a challenging task as it often does not follow any specific pattern. However, deep neural learning can be used to identify patterns through machine learning. One of the most effective techniques for series forecasting is using LSTM (long short-term memory) networks, which are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of remembering information over a long period of time.  
__YEAR__: 2022  
__FOCUS__: educational, example, description

> [hungchun-lin/Stock-price-prediction-using-GAN](https://github.com/hungchun-lin/Stock-price-prediction-using-GAN)
__AIM__: compare two algorithms for stock prediction. First, we will utilize the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network to do the Stock Market Prediction. LSTM is a powerful method that is capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. Furthermore, we will utilize Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to make the prediction. LSTM will be used as a generator, and CNN as a discriminator. In addition, Natural Language Processing(NLP) will also be used in this project to analyze the influence of News on stock prices.
