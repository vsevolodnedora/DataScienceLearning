# [Machine Learning Fundamentals: Cross Validation](https://youtu.be/fSytzGwwBVw?si=tz9PSNmLz__-QEen)

- A technique to _compare_ different ML methods and assess their usefullness for the problem or to __test the algorithm__. 

1. Train the ML method
2. Test the method

The data _has to be split_ into the one used for trainin and the one used for testing.  

In Cross-Validation, a method is trained on a _set of data splits_ and the performance results are compared. 

`Leave one out cross validation` - using only one data sample for testing and the test for training, Commonly used _Ten Fould Cross Validation_ where data is devided into 10 blocks. 

Cross valudation also allows to tune the model parameters.
